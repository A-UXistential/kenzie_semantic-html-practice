        <h2>"One must be Brave. One must be Bold. Or the one won't be You."</h2> 
            <p>I enjoy poetic expressions of everyday life. As a natural story-teller, weaving words visually to paint images, thoughts and pictures <br>
            that depict the life of a woman in the world but not of this worlc. My portfolio is a human-centered, professional expression of creative, <br>
            passion and deep reflection on questions like "What Would Jesus Do?" and "What if I were in their shoes?" This is the essence of my design <br>
            approach which is human-centered. Which keeps me humbly grounded, so that I may never boast, instead that I may be of helpful service to others.<br> 
            How I can help you problem-solve with purposefully and strategically through design?<br>
